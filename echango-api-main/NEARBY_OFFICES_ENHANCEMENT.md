# Nearby Offices Endpoint Enhancement

## Overview

The nearby offices endpoint has been significantly enhanced to support all the filters shown in the UI and provide better functionality, error handling, and performance.

## üêõ Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. Incorrect Office Status Filtering
**Issue**: The repository was filtering for `isActive = false` and `isVerified = false`, returning only inactive and unverified offices.

**Fix**: Changed to `isActive = true` and `isVerified = true` by default, with configurable filtering based on filter parameters.

```typescript
// Before (WRONG)
.where('office.isActive = :isActive', { isActive: false })
.andWhere('office.isVerified = :isVerified', { isVerified: false })

// After (CORRECT)
.where('office.isActive = :isActive', { 
  isActive: filter.isActive !== undefined ? filter.isActive : true 
})
.andWhere('office.isVerified = :isVerified', { 
  isVerified: filter.isVerified !== undefined ? filter.isVerified : true 
})
```

## üÜï New Filter Features

### 1. Office Hours Filtering (`showOnlyOpenNow`)
- **Description**: Filter offices that are currently open based on their working hours
- **Implementation**: Created `OfficeHoursUtil` utility class with comprehensive time checking logic
- **Features**:
  - Handles different days of the week
  - Supports break times
  - Handles overnight hours (e.g., 22:00 to 02:00)
  - Timezone-aware calculations

### 2. Featured Offices Filter (`isFeatured`)
- **Description**: Filter for offices marked as featured
- **Usage**: `?isFeatured=true`

### 3. Office Status Filters
- **`isActive`**: Filter by office active status
- **`isVerified`**: Filter by office verification status

### 4. Trending Filters
- **`isPopular`**: Sort by popular offices (based on featured status and establishment date)
- **`mostSearched`**: Sort by most searched offices (based on analytics data)
- **`nearest`**: Sort by distance (existing, improved)

## üîß Enhanced Existing Features

### 1. Currency Filtering Improvements
- **Better validation**: Empty string and null checks
- **Rate filtering**: Support for minimum rate thresholds
- **Available currencies**: Improved handling of currency lists
- **Direction handling**: Enhanced BUY/SELL rate direction logic

### 2. Input Validation
- **Latitude**: Must be between -90 and 90
- **Longitude**: Must be between -180 and 180
- **Radius**: Must be between 1 and 1000 km
- **Currency rate**: Must be positive when provided
- **Rate direction**: Required when currency rate is specified

### 3. Error Handling
- **Structured error responses**: Consistent error format across all endpoints
- **Specific error messages**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Graceful degradation**: Handles missing data gracefully

## üìä New Response Fields

### 1. Distance Information
```typescript
{
  "distanceInKm": 2.5  // Distance from search point in kilometers
}
```

### 2. Today's Working Hours
```typescript
{
  "todayWorkingHours": {
    "dayOfWeek": "MONDAY",
    "isActive": true,
    "fromTime": "09:00",
    "toTime": "17:00",
    "hasBreak": true,
    "breakFromTime": "12:00",
    "breakToTime": "13:00"
  }
}
```

### 3. Equivalent Value Calculation
```typescript
{
  "equivalentValue": 1050.0  // Calculated based on exchange rate and amount
}
```

## üîç API Usage Examples

### Basic Search
```bash
GET /api/v1/offices/nearby?latitude=33.5731&longitude=-7.5898&radiusInKm=10
```

### Currency Exchange Search
```bash
GET /api/v1/offices/nearby?latitude=33.5731&longitude=-7.5898&radiusInKm=10&baseCurrency=MAD&targetCurrency=USD&rateDirection=SELL
```

### Featured Offices Only
```bash
GET /api/v1/offices/nearby?latitude=33.5731&longitude=-7.5898&radiusInKm=10&isFeatured=true
```

### Currently Open Offices
```bash
GET /api/v1/offices/nearby?latitude=33.5731&longitude=-7.5898&radiusInKm=10&showOnlyOpenNow=true
```

### Popular Offices
```bash
GET /api/v1/offices/nearby?latitude=33.5731&longitude=-7.5898&radiusInKm=10&isPopular=true
```

### Complex Filter Combination
```bash
GET /api/v1/offices/nearby?latitude=33.5731&longitude=-7.5898&radiusInKm=10&isActive=true&isVerified=true&isFeatured=true&showOnlyOpenNow=true&baseCurrency=MAD&targetCurrency=USD
```

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Tests
- Created comprehensive test suite in `src/offices/tests/nearby-offices.test.ts`
- Tests cover input validation, currency processing, filter handling, and error scenarios

### Manual Testing Script
- Created `test-nearby-endpoint.js` for manual API testing
- Includes test cases for all filter combinations
- Tests both success and error scenarios

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test src/offices/tests/nearby-offices.test.ts

# Run manual API tests (ensure server is running)
node test-nearby-endpoint.js
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements

### 1. Utility Classes
- **`OfficeHoursUtil`**: Handles all office hours calculations
- **Reusable**: Can be used across different parts of the application

### 2. Better Separation of Concerns
- **Service Layer**: Handles business logic and validation
- **Repository Layer**: Handles data access and filtering
- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP request/response mapping

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Consistent error format**: All errors follow the same structure
- **Specific error codes**: Each validation error has a specific code
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues to work even with partial data

## üöÄ Performance Considerations

### 1. Database Query Optimization
- **Single query**: All filtering done in one database query where possible
- **Proper indexing**: Spatial indexes for location-based queries
- **Efficient joins**: Optimized joins for related data

### 2. Post-Query Filtering
- **Office hours**: Applied after database query for complex time logic
- **Memory efficient**: Only processes offices that match basic criteria

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### 1. Analytics Integration
- **Real popularity metrics**: Use actual view/interaction data for popularity
- **Search tracking**: Track search patterns for better "most searched" results

### 2. Caching
- **Redis caching**: Cache frequently searched locations
- **Working hours cache**: Cache today's working hours calculations

### 3. Advanced Filtering
- **Rating system**: Filter by office ratings
- **Service types**: Filter by specific services offered
- **Language support**: Filter by languages spoken

## üìù Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
- None. All changes are backward compatible.

### New Dependencies
- No new external dependencies added.

### Database Changes
- No database schema changes required.
- Existing indexes are sufficient for the new functionality.

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables required. The enhancement uses existing configuration.

### Feature Flags
All new features are enabled by default but can be controlled through the filter parameters.
